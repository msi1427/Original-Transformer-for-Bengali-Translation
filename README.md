# Original Transformer for Bengali Translation [Work in Progress]

I come from a developing country named Bangladesh. Our mother tongue is Bengali. In this project, my plan is to translate different languages to Bengali. I am fascinated by the transformer architecture and here I also plan to implement the whole architecture from scratch using PyTorch. I also have plans to deploy the model after the project. 

## Transformer

Transformer architecture was first introduced by Ashish Vaswani et. al. in [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper. <br/>

 I used the following resources to understand the paper: <br/>
